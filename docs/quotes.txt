Keep your thoughts positive because your thoughts become your words. Keep your
words positive because your words become your behaviors. Keep your behaviors
positive because your behaviors become your habits. Keep your habits positive
because your habits become your values. Keep your values positive because your
values become your destiny.

A tree never asks for a lighter burden, only broader shoulders.
