        Have you ever felt like you're wandering in the wilderness, experiencing
        despair, hopelessness, regret and you don't know where to turn? You may
        need to consider asking for a guide through your life's dark times. Some
        call this person a coach or a guide, others may use the terms counsellor
        or therapist. Either way you likely need someone to support and
        encourage you.

        Peter Barnes, in association with others, provides grief therapy,
        spiritual care and guidance, person-centred support, and narrative
        therapy.
