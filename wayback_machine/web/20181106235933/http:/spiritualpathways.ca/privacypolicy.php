                    <p><strong>How we use cookies </strong><br/>
                      A cookie is a small file which asks   permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file   is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you   visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an   individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes   and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your   preferences.</p>
                    <p>We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used.
