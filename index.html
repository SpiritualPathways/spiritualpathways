            Have you ever felt like you're wandering in the wilderness, experiencing
            despair, hopelessness, regret and you don't know where to turn? You may
            need to consider asking for a guide through your life's dark times. Some
            call this person a coach or a guide, others may use the terms counsellor
            or therapist. Either way you likely need someone to support and
            encourage you.

            Peter Barnes, in association with others, provides grief therapy,
            spiritual care and guidance, person-centred support, and narrative
            therapy.

            Clients seeking help are often those who need to chart a course to
            recovery or healing requiring heartfelt discernment and a safe
            environment, beginning with developing a relationship in which trust and
            life experience are essential. Spiritual Pathways are the ways people
            have of growing and reflecting on the challenges of life so that through
            sharing with a guide or coach they are helped to see their lives from a
            different perspective and are helped to chart a new course that
            transforms struggles into informed awareness of change, and new ways of
            approaching the past difficulties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether its loss related, uncertainties, loneliness, or new
            opportunities to be explored, you may need help to chart a spiritual
            pathway in order to grow into a new life experience of enhanced meaning
            and purpose.
